/**
 * Returns context environment variables to inject into shell subprocesses.
 *
 * Reads dynamic context (session ID, agent ID, prompt ID) from
 * AsyncLocalStorage at call time, falling back to process.env for the
 * session ID (set by Config at session start in the single-session CLI).
 * This enables downstream scripts to identify which session, agent, and
 * prompt triggered their execution — useful for tracing, audit logging,
 * and business context correlation.
 *
 * The ALS-first lookup matters in daemon mode: one process hosts many
 * sessions, but only the first Config ever claims the process-global
 * env slot (`sessionEnvClaimed` in config.ts), so process.env alone
 * would report a stale session ID for every later session.
 *
 * Must be called at spawn time within the executing async context to
 * capture the correct session/agent/prompt frame.

/**
 * An entry a POSIX shell cannot exec directly. The gate demands POSITIVE
 * evidence of executability rather than enumerating known-bad shapes: an
 * enumeration answered "usable" for everything outside it, and two such
 * shapes reached the stamp in the wild — a tsx dev launch whose argv[1] is a
 * 0644 `index.ts`, and `node <pkg-dir>` whose argv[1] is the DIRECTORY, both
 * of which a shell exec answers with exit 126 while `${QWEN_CODE_CLI:-qwen}`
 * would have fallen back on empty.
 *
 * Usable means: a REGULAR file (a directory passes an X_OK probe — search
 * permission — so executability alone cannot gate it out), with execute
 * permission, that is either a `#!`-headed script (any extension) or a
 * non-script file (a native binary needs no shebang). A known script
 * extension without a shebang is unusable even when executable — the kernel
 * would hand it to a shell as shell script. The desktop tooling's vendored
 * bundle (no shebang) and a shebang-bearing 0644 script both stay filtered,
 * exactly as before. Cached per path: this runs on every shell spawn, and
 * the answer for a given entry does not change in-process.
 *
 * Exported because a producer of the stamp has to apply the same test the
 * consumer here does: `qwen review run` stamps the entry it re-enters, and a
 * stamp this function would blank is worse than no stamp — it names a path the
 * skill's `"${QWEN_CODE_CLI:-qwen}"` cannot exec, instead of falling back.

  // run died on `Missing required argument: chunk` — the skill and the CLI running

  // So the entry is passed down instead of rediscovered. The bin wrapper sets it

  // and falls back to `qwen` when it is absent, which is exactly the old behaviour.
