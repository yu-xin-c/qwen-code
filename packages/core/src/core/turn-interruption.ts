/**
 * Classification of how a session's last turn ended, computed from persisted
 * chat history alone (no in-memory request refs), so it works across process
 * restarts — unlike the Ctrl+Y retry path, which depends on
 * `lastPromptRef` surviving in the same process.
 *
 * The history tail determines the classification:
 *  - `interrupted_prompt`: the tail is one or more non-structural `user`
 *    entries — a prompt (or a tool_result submission) whose model response
 *    never landed. Continuing means re-submitting their `parts` with Retry
 *    semantics: the send path strips the orphaned trailing user entries and
 *    re-pushes the same content under the same logical turn, so the transcript
 *    gains no new user message.
 *  - `interrupted_turn`: the tail is a `model` entry carrying `functionCall`s
 *    that no `functionResponse` ever answered (crash/abort mid tool run).
 *    Continuing means closing each pair with a synthesized error
 *    `functionResponse` submitted as a ToolResult — a legal continuation
 *    signal that needs no synthetic user text.
 *  - `none`: the turn ended cleanly (model text tail), the tail is a
 *    structural pure system-reminder entry (strip refuses to pop those, so a
 *    Retry would duplicate content), or history is empty.
 *
 * A model text tail that was truncated mid-stream is indistinguishable from
 * a clean finish without persisted stop_reason metadata, so it classifies as
 * `none` here; recovering that case needs provider prefill support and is
 * tracked separately.
