// `qwen review drive`: start something, wait until it is actually up, drive it,
// and capture what it did — as facts, not as a guess about how long to sleep.
//
// The maintainer verification this borrows from is the highest-yield review
// technique in this repo's history: build the PR, run the real product, watch
// what it does. Measured across 260 of those sessions, the mechanical half is
// the same every time and it is done by hand every time — and two of its three
// steps are done by GUESSING:
//
//   - **81% waited with `sleep N`**, and only 36% polled for a readiness
//     signal. A `sleep 2` that lands before the daemon binds its port makes
//     `capture-pane` return an empty screen, and an empty screen reads as "the
//     feature does not work". That is a false negative produced by the harness,
//     and it is silent — which is the one failure mode this pipeline treats as
//     worse than a missed finding.
//   - **74% captured one screenful** with no way to know whether the command
//     had finished. A capture taken mid-write is a truncated observation
//     presented as a complete one.
//   - **87% cleaned up by hand**, with `pkill -f <a name they made up>` plus a
//     `kill-server`. What the previous round leaked, the next round inherits.
//
// So this command owns exactly those three: **ready or not** (polled, with the
// wait reported), **finished or not** (a sentinel the driven script must reach,
// with its exit code), and **cleaned up regardless** (a named server this
// command owns end to end). What to drive and what the output means stay with
// the caller — the same split `build-test` and `test-delta` already draw.
//
// Nothing here interprets the captured text. A run that never became ready, or
// never reached its sentinel, reports what it observed AND that the observation
// is partial; it does not hand back a screenful and let the reader assume it is
// the whole story.

   * address attributes 8931's readings to the daemon on 8932. The script has
   * to derive the address from the service's own output before its first

   * is the one the service printed. The verify brief carries the recipe.
   *
   * The address a service actually bound is the motivating one, and it is not
   * the address it was asked for: `qwen serve` handed a taken port prints
   * `port 8931 is in use, trying 8932...` and listens on the next one. A caller
