// `qwen review ab-drive`: run ONE script against TWO trees and hand back the
// paired observation — the A/B's runtime form, with the pairing done by code
// instead of by hand.
//
// `base-tree` made the other program buildable and `drive` made one run
// observable; what stayed by hand was the A/B itself: two drive invocations a
// verifier writes twice, and everything that can silently diverge between them
// is a confound reported as a finding. The maintainer harness this borrows
// from (the #9131-style verification: one real daemon, a PR arm and a base arm
// watching the same event stream) pairs the arms by hand every time, and the
// three facts that make its differences evidence are exactly the facts a hand
// pairing loses first:
//
//   - **Same bytes.** Two hand-written drive calls drift — a flag in one, a
//     path in the other — and a difference between arms then measures the
//     harness. Here one `--script` serves both arms verbatim (the report
//     carries its digest), with `AB_ARM`/`AB_ARM_ROOT` as the only variation.
//   - **Same upstream, owned.** A shared daemon or mock stood up by hand
//     outlives the run (the `pkill` guessing `drive`'s header measures), or
//     dies mid-arm and turns arm B's observation into a comparison against a
//     corpse. Here the shared process is started, readiness-polled, liveness-
//     checked at each arm's end, and killed unconditionally.
//   - **Confounds named.** A difference between arms is the verdict, so a
//     harness-made difference is the one failure that matters. The report's
//     `observed` gate is false unless BOTH arms completed AND the shared
//     process (when there is one) outlived each arm it served.
//
// The shared process defaults to ONE INSTANCE PER ARM — fresh state for each —
// because with a single instance and sequential arms, whatever arm A mutates
// is arm B's starting state, and the A/B then manufactures exactly the false
// difference it exists to rule out. `--shared-once` opts into a single
// instance across both arms, for the observer shape where sameness of the
// upstream IS the point and the arms only watch.
//
// What to run and what a difference means stay with the verifier — the same
// split `drive`, `base-tree` and `extract-step` already draw.
